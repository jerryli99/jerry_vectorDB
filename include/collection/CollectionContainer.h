/**
 * @brief CollectionContainer will be a hashmap for storing the collections. 
 *        The ColllectionId will be a string as key, and collection as value. 
 * 
 *          Scope: Manages collections as a whole.
 *          Purpose: Acts as a top-level registry or container of multiple collections.
 *          Responsibilities:
 *          Add, remove, lookup collections by name or ID.
 *          Manage collection lifecycle (creation, deletion).
 *          Handle concurrency for collection-level operations.
 *          Analogy: Like a library shelf that holds many books (collections).
