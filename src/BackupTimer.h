/*
Implement a timer to backup data periodicly, by using threads (i might actually try the async stuff 
so i don't need to manually manage thread controlling)

For redesigning the whole db, i might use a time wheel like in linux kernel to managing merging segments, db replications,...

In distributed storage, for nodes to communicate to each other, maybe using a timer can help "heart beat" in networking
