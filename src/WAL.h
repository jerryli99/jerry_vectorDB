/*
Write ahead log for the vectors. The payloads are handled by rocksdb, so don't worry about them
WAL idea is about persist before itâ€™s acknowledged.
I probably will not implement the full recovery of data, we will see.

WAL in my understanding is before i add vectors to memory pool, need to append them to the WAL file.
Insert flow:
User calls insertPoint() etc
You serialize the insert operation to the WAL (append to file).
Then you apply the insert operation to the memory pool / active segment.
If crash happens after WAL but before memory, replay restores it.
If crash happens after memory but before WAL, replay re-applies it (idempotent, you overwrite same ID).

Replay:
On startup, you open the WAL.
For each entry, reconstruct Point and put it back into the active segment (or memory pool).
Then resume as if nothing happened.


| checksum | entry_type | collection_name | point_id | named_vec_count | [[vec_name, dim, data], [vec_name, dim, data], ...] |

entry type meaning insert, delete, update, etc. In my case for now, just do insert.
