/**
 * @brief The goal of impl the SmartArray (predict the dynamic array capacity growth)
 *        is to experiment and learn what can be done to manage memory in 1 dimension.
 *        I am not sure how this will turn out since by the time writing this I have 
 *        zero idea what I am doing; however, I do hope to future explore this idea in
 *        2D memory management with different data structures in the future. We will see.
